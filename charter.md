The ELEGY working group will develop a document that will update Section 4.14 of
RFC 8713 and become part of BCP 10, and that specifies the criteria for IETF
NomCom eligibility going forward. The document will be informed by the RFC 8989
experiment and will address meetings held in person, including hybrid formats,
as well as those held online only. It will cover ONLY qualification to
volunteer for the NomCom (and to take roles in the recall process that are tied
to that qualification). No other aspect of NomCom selection or operation is in
scope.
